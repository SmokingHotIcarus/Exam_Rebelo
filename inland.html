                The Drakensberg is the name given to the eastern portion of the Great Escarpment, 
                which encloses the central Southern African plateau. 
                The Great Escarpment reaches its greatest elevation – 2,000 to 3,482 metres (6,562 to 11,424 feet) 
                within the border region of South Africa and Lesotho.

                The Drakensberg escarpment stretches for more than 1,000 kilometres (600 miles) from the 
                Eastern Cape Province in the South, then successively forms, in order from south to north, 
                the border between Lesotho and the Eastern Cape and the border between 
                Lesotho and KwaZulu-Natal Province. 
                <br><br>
                Thereafter it forms the border between KwaZulu-Natal 
                and the Free State, and next as the border between KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga Province. 
                The escarpment winds north from there, through Mpumalanga, where it includes features 
                such as the Blyde River Canyon, Three Rondavels, and God's Window. 
                It then extends farther north to Hoedspruit in southeastern Limpopo where it is known as 'Klein Drankensberg' 
                by the Afrikaner. From Hoedspruit it extends west to Tzaneen, also in Limpopo Province, 
                where it is known as the Wolkberg Mountains and Iron Crown Mountain. 
                <br><br>
                At 2,200 m (7,200 ft) 
                above sea level, the Wolkberg is the highest elevation in Limpopo. 
                The escarpment extends west again and at Mokopane it is known as the Strydpoort Mountains.

            <p>Kruger National Park is a South African National Park and one of the largest game reserves in Africa. It covers an area of 19,485 km2 (7,523 sq mi) in the provinces of Limpopo and Mpumalanga in northeastern South Africa, and extends 360 km (220 mi) from north to south and 65 km (40 mi) from east to west. The administrative headquarters are in Skukuza. Areas of the park were first protected by the government of the South African Republic in 1898, and it became South Africa's first national park in 1926.</p>

            <p>To the west and south of the Kruger National Park are the two South African provinces of Limpopo and Mpumalanga, respectively. To the north is Zimbabwe, and to the east is Mozambique. <br><br> It is now part of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park, a peace park that links Kruger National Park with the Gonarezhou National Park in Zimbabwe, and with the Limpopo National Park in Mozambique.
            The park is part of the Kruger to Canyons Biosphere, an area designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as an International Man and Biosphere Reserve. The park has nine main gates allowing entrance to the different camps.</p>
